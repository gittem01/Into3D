# Into3D

# Future plans (maybe):
- add vulkan support (when finished learning vulkan)
- add terrain (with physics)
- add model loading (glTF will be used most likely)
- android support (optional)

## Ranking matters

# Required libraries:

- glfw
- glm
- reactphysics3d
- imgui

# libraries are not included with the repository user must download and link them by her/him self
