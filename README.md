# Into3D

## Ranking matters
# Future plans (maybe):
- add vulkan support (when finished learning vulkan)
- add terrain (with physics)
- add model loading (glTF will be used most likely)
- android support (optional)


### libraries are not included with the repository user must download and link them by her/him self

# Required libraries:

- glfw
- glm
- reactphysics3d
- imgui

Nothing is fully tested. Half of the classes are taken from my other project classes so there are lots of unnecessary code arround.
